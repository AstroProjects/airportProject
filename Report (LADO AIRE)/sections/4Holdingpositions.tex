\chapter{Holding positions}

	\section{Introduction}
	\paragraph{} Because traffic density will be medium or heavy, holding bays will be designed. Hence, runway-holding positions will be established:
	on the taxiways, at the intersection of a taxiway and a runway and at an intersection of a runway with another runway when the former runway is part of a standard taxi-route.
	
	A runway-holding position will be established on a taxiway if the location or alignment of the taxiway is such that a taxiing aircraft or vehicle can infringe an obstacle limitation surface or interfere with the operation of radio navigation aids.

	\paragraph{} Following figure \ref{distances}, minimum distances will be chosen. The location of a runway-holding position established will be such that a holding aircraft or vehicle will not infringe the obstacle free zone, approach surface, take-off climb surface or ILS/MLS critical/ sensitive area or interfere with the operation of radio navigation aids.
	
	\section{Clearance distances on aircraft stands}
	\paragraph{} An aircraft stand will provide the following minimum clearances between an aircraft entering or exiting the stand and any adjacent building, aircraft on another stand and other objects:
