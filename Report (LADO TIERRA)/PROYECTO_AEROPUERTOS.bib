abstract = {Passenger traffic makes its strongest start to the year since 2008  The strong start to the year for global air passenger market continued in February (helped by the leap year).  The upward trend in seasonally-adjusted passenger traffic remains robust.  The industry load factor fell in year-on-year terms for first time since mid-2015. To be monitored.  Further stimulus from lower oil prices is likely to offset modest underlying demand momentum.},

abstract = {This commentary is the annual MCTF report discussing airline maintenance costs and their trends. We analyzed airline operational data and maintenance cost data from airlines worldwide. 48 airlines participated in the 2013 data collection. In 2013, world fleet consisted in 23,731 aircraft (including large turboprops); 56{\%} of them are narrowbody aircraft. Maintenance, Repairs and Overhaul (MRO) market reached {\$}60.7 Bill. (excluding overhead cost). The 48 MCTF participating airlines reported a total fleet of 3,779 aircraft (16{\%} of the world fleet) for 2013. Boeing aircraft represented the majority (53{\%}), followed by Airbus with 37{\%}. Narrowbody aircraft represented over 53{\%} of the fleet, while wide-body aircraft accounted for 38{\%} of the fleet; the remaining being regional jets and turboprops. Direct maintenance cost was {\$}13.1 Bill. The average maintenance cost was {\$}1,167 per flight hour, {\$}3,021 per flight cycle and {\$} 3.1 Mill. per aircraft. Engine maintenance remained the highest cost segment; 42{\%} of direct maintenance cost. 34 airlines reported their number of staff. They employed an average of 11 mechanics per aircraft and 6 overhead staff (i.e. additional administrative and professional staff) per aircraft. On average, overhead costs (labor and nonlabor overhead) accounted for 19{\%} of total Technical Division costs. 28 airlines provided time breakdown data. The average ‘Productive Time' reported in 2013 was 1,337 hours per person and the average ‘Maximum Potential Time' was 2,142 hours. Based on an 8-hour work day, a mechanic was productive for about 5.2 hours per day. 39 out of 48 airlines leased at least part of their fleet in 2013. On average, 27{\%} of MCTF fleet was leased. 22 MCTF airlines reported paying maintenance reserves to lessors for a total of {\$}384 Mill. Engine (i.e. engine maintenance + engine LLPs) represented 79{\%} of these maintenance reserves. For 35 reporting airlines, spare parts inventory amounted {\$}11.1 Bill in 2013. With an estimated carrying cost of 21{\%}, there was an additional annual cost of {\$}2.33 Bill. In comparison, the direct maintenance costs of these 35 airlines was {\$}10.6 Bill. The average inventory value was {\$}3.1 Mill per aircraft. For 2013, we introduced a new level of analysis: by airline group based on fleet size. Direct maintenance cost for Group One (26 airlines with up to 50 aircraft) reached {\$}1.56 Bill. The average cost per FH was {\$}1,225. For Group Two (11 airlines with 51 to 100 aircraft), direct maintenance cost reached {\$}2.47Bill. With an average cost per FH of {\$}952. Group Three (11 airlines operating 101+ aircraft) reported a total of {\$}9.1Bill. for direct maintenance cost and average cost per FH of {\$}1,245. Out of 48 airlines, 26 have been reporting data consistently for the past four years, allowing MCTF to conduct trend analysis. In FY2013, they operated 2,660 aircraft. Direct maintenance cost for this group of airlines reached {\$}9.44Bill. The average maintenance cost was {\$}1,067 per flight hour, {\$}2,652 per flight cycle and {\$} 3.55 Mill. per aircraft.},
