abstract = {This commentary is the annual MCTF report discussing airline maintenance costs and their trends. We analyzed airline operational data and maintenance cost data from airlines worldwide. 48 airlines participated in the 2013 data collection. In 2013, world fleet consisted in 23,731 aircraft (including large turboprops); 56{\%} of them are narrowbody aircraft. Maintenance, Repairs and Overhaul (MRO) market reached {\$}60.7 Bill. (excluding overhead cost). The 48 MCTF participating airlines reported a total fleet of 3,779 aircraft (16{\%} of the world fleet) for 2013. Boeing aircraft represented the majority (53{\%}), followed by Airbus with 37{\%}. Narrowbody aircraft represented over 53{\%} of the fleet, while wide-body aircraft accounted for 38{\%} of the fleet; the remaining being regional jets and turboprops. Direct maintenance cost was {\$}13.1 Bill. The average maintenance cost was {\$}1,167 per flight hour, {\$}3,021 per flight cycle and {\$} 3.1 Mill. per aircraft. Engine maintenance remained the highest cost segment; 42{\%} of direct maintenance cost. 34 airlines reported their number of staff. They employed an average of 11 mechanics per aircraft and 6 overhead staff (i.e. additional administrative and professional staff) per aircraft. On average, overhead costs (labor and nonlabor overhead) accounted for 19{\%} of total Technical Division costs. 28 airlines provided time breakdown data. The average ‘Productive Time' reported in 2013 was 1,337 hours per person and the average ‘Maximum Potential Time' was 2,142 hours. Based on an 8-hour work day, a mechanic was productive for about 5.2 hours per day. 39 out of 48 airlines leased at least part of their fleet in 2013. On average, 27{\%} of MCTF fleet was leased. 22 MCTF airlines reported paying maintenance reserves to lessors for a total of {\$}384 Mill. Engine (i.e. engine maintenance + engine LLPs) represented 79{\%} of these maintenance reserves. For 35 reporting airlines, spare parts inventory amounted {\$}11.1 Bill in 2013. With an estimated carrying cost of 21{\%}, there was an additional annual cost of {\$}2.33 Bill. In comparison, the direct maintenance costs of these 35 airlines was {\$}10.6 Bill. The average inventory value was {\$}3.1 Mill per aircraft. For 2013, we introduced a new level of analysis: by airline group based on fleet size. Direct maintenance cost for Group One (26 airlines with up to 50 aircraft) reached {\$}1.56 Bill. The average cost per FH was {\$}1,225. For Group Two (11 airlines with 51 to 100 aircraft), direct maintenance cost reached {\$}2.47Bill. With an average cost per FH of {\$}952. Group Three (11 airlines operating 101+ aircraft) reported a total of {\$}9.1Bill. for direct maintenance cost and average cost per FH of {\$}1,245. Out of 48 airlines, 26 have been reporting data consistently for the past four years, allowing MCTF to conduct trend analysis. In FY2013, they operated 2,660 aircraft. Direct maintenance cost for this group of airlines reached {\$}9.44Bill. The average maintenance cost was {\$}1,067 per flight hour, {\$}2,652 per flight cycle and {\$} 3.55 Mill. per aircraft.},

@article{Edwards1994,
abstract = {The origin of potassic lavas with within-plate characteristics in island are settings is unclear. The volcanic complex of Ringgit—Beser, situated in eastern Java, has erupted lavas of both normal island are calc-alkaline type and atypical potassic lavas, including some highly magnesian lavas. The occurrence of these primitive lavas gives an unusual insight into the source characteristics of the potassic lavas.The lavas from Ringgit—Beser have a wide range of K2O (1.1–6.4 wt. {\%}) and MgO contents (18.0–1.6 wt.{\%}). The most magnesian lavas have high Ni and Cr contents. The calc-alkaline lavas have incompatible trace element patterns typical of island are lavas with enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE) relative to high field strength elements (HFSE) and heavy REE (HREE). The potassic lavas may be divided into two series on the basis of Ba and Nb contents, with the enriched potassic (EK) series having higher Ba and Nb contents for a given MgO content than the potassic (K) series. The EK and K series lavas have some incompatible trace element ratios similar to within-plate lavas (e.g., high Ce/Pb, low LILE/HFSE ratios, and low B/Be). However, both the EK series and K series lavas have negative Ti and Zr anomalies, and the EK series lavas have high Ba/La similar to are lavas. There is little distinction in Sr and Nd isotopes between the K and EK series, but the calc-alkaline lavas have lower 87Sr/86Sr and higher 143Nd/144Nd ratios than the potassic lavas. The EK series lavas have lower 206Pb/204Pb and higher 208Pb/204Pb than the K series lavas, but similar 207Pb/204Pb ratios. The K series lavas define an almost horizontal trend in 207Pb−206Pb space. The Pb isotopic ratios indicate that the EK series lavas are derived from a single mantle source, whereas the K series originate from a mixture of two mantle components. Calc-alkaline lavas have Pb isotope ratios similar to other calc-alkaline and tholeiitic lavas from Java, and plot on a mixing line between Indian Ocean mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) and Indian Ocean sediment.Incompatible trace element and Pb isotope data for the calc-alkaline lavas indicate that these lavas have a similar source to other calc-alkaline lavas erupted in Java, namely melts of the Indian Ocean MORB mantle fluxed by fluids from the subducted slab. The potassic lavas originate from enriched mantle sources within the wedge which have not been affected by recent subduction processes. The EK series lavas are derived from a metasomatized zone which has EMI-type characteristics. The K series lavas are derived from mixing of melts from Christmas Island-type (EMII) mantle and the metasomatized zone. The metasomatized zone is probably situated at the base of the lithosphere and the Indian Ocean MORB and Christmas Island-type mantle components are situated in the asthenosphere of the wedge. Isotopic data for Ringgit—Beser lavas confirm that the mantle wedge of the Sunda arc is extremely heterogeneous (Foden {\&} Varne, 1980; Varne, 1985; Wheller et al., 1987).The similarity in geochemistry between Indonesian potassic lavas and those erupted in continental settings indicates that the magma source is essentially the same, namely a metasomatized phlogopite-rich layer generated by melts of recycled subducted lithosphere. The lack of negative Ti anomalies in the continental potassic lavas is ascribed to lower oxidation states in the mantle in continental settings.},

Volume 1 of ACRP Report 25 explores the passenger terminal planning process and provides, in a single reference document, the important criteria and requirements needed to help address emerging trends and develop potential solutions for airport passenger terminals. Volume 1 addresses the airside, terminal building, and landside components of the terminal complex. Volume 2 of ACRP Report 25 consists of a CD-ROM containing 11 spreadsheet models, which include practical learning exercises and several airport-specific sample data sets to assist users in determining appropriate model inputs for their situations, and a user's guide to assist the user in the correct use of each model. The models on the CD-ROM include such aspects of terminal planning as design hour determination, gate demand, check-in and passenger and baggage screening, which require complex analyses to support planning decisions. The CD-ROM is also available for download from TRB's website as an ISO image.},
