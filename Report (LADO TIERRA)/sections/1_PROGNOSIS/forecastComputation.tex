\section{Forecast computation}
In order to do a realistic study for the new Bekasi-East airport traffic, it is previously established the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK) as the reference airport for the for the future operations prevision. According to one of the IATA main recommended methods for the elaboration of traffic previsions, data from historical series of CGK traffic has been used so as to be able to extrapolate the study horizons of the airport to be designed.

In order to do this, it is necessary to calculate the variation tendency 

Before starting the study of passenger and operation demands, some important aspects will be taken into account:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The airport to be projected will absorb nearly the 40\% of CGKâ€™s current traffic, which corresponds to the percentage of delayed flights due to congestion.
	\item The growth tendencies, concretely the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), has been calculated using the data corresponding to the five more recent years.
	\item The prediction of passengers and operations have been calculated using three possible scenario.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Neutral scenario: The growth is constant along time
		\item Optimistic scenario: The growth is constant along time but in 2025 is multiplied by a factor of 1,5 due to, for example, a boom of tourism in the city.
		\item Pessimistic scenario: The growth is constant along time but in 2025 is divided by a factor of 2 due to, for example, a period of time with adverse atmospheric phenomena.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In addition, both the airlines as well as the percentage of operations absorbed from CGK are detailed in the following table:
