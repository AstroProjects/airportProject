	\section{Fire prevention regulations }
		\subsection{Level of protection}
		\paragraph{} From ICAO Annex 14 V1, the level of protection at an aerodrome for rescue and firefighting should be equal to aerodrome category determined using the principles in articles \textit{9.2.5} and \textit{9.2.6}.
		
		Table \ref{table91} is used to determine the aerodrome category taking into account the longest aeroplanes normally using the aerodrome.
		
		The biggest plane using the aerodrome is the Boeing 777-300 which have a length of 74m and a fuselage width of 6.2m.
		
		According to this data, the \textbf{Aerodrome category} is \textbf{9}.

		\subsection{Extinguishing agents}
		\paragraph{} Also, from ICAO Annex 14 V1, section 9, the amounts of water for foam production and the complementary agents to be provided on the rescue and firefighting vehicles shall be in accordance with the aerodrome category.
		
		From \textit{Airport Services Manual (Doc 9137), Part 1} and the category of the airport, the level of performance selected is \textbf{level A}. Now the table \ref{table92} can be used to determine the minimum usable amount of extinguishing agents for the airport.
